One of the best and most heartwarming and unique bowls of ramen that we had in Osaka, Japan was Ramen Yashichi. Weekian was so insistent on going there, even though it was out of the way of our itinerary. And now I know why.

When we arrived, it was about 1.15pm and I was starving (having not had breakfast that morning). Since the restaurant was full, the staff deeply apologized (with the polite manner that all Japanese seem to have) and asked us if we were willing to wait. I almost backed out because I was so hungry, but decided to wait, since we’d already gone all the way there.

We were given a little queue card stating the time we were supposed to be back there, and we both agreed that it was an effective and economical system. There wasn’t anywhere else to go, so we decided to sit at the nearby park to read.

When it was our turn, we waited only for about 5 minutes more before we could order our food. We were so sad to find that we’d just missed the last BBQ pork rice bowl! If you’re intending to go here, definitely go early to not miss any menu items. In the end, we just ordered 2 bowls of <span class="dish">Shoyu Ramen (¥730)</span>.

Since we were seated beside the kitchen, we could watch how meticulous and precise they were as they cooked the bowls of ramen. I could just feel the love put into their food.

The generous toppings added so much texture to the ramen, making the whole experience so much more interesting. The noodles itself was not too hard or soft, YUMZ. But we thought the onions were just a liiiitle bit overpowering because they were cut a slightly big – No worries though, if you don’t like onions you can easily take them out. The egg was perfectly cooked (TOTALLY Belle-approved).

And the broth – boy oh boy, it was the best broth we’ve ever had. It was a perfect balance of saltiness and creaminess, which gave it a full and rounded flavour. We slurped every bit of the soup up. YUMZ x 1000.

Together with the balanced flavours and great portion size, we did not get that gelat-ness at all. It was the first time I ever finished a whole bowl of ramen, soup and all. Overall, this meal made us feel so happy and warm.

We say… <span class="rating">9.5/10!</span> :) A must-visit when you’re in Osaka!
