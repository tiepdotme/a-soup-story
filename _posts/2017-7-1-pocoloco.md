We’re kicking off our first post with one of our favourites – PocoLoco!

Situated at a quiet corner in Ang Mo Kio Ave 10, PocoLoco is a cosy and family-friendly restaurant. The restaurant is dimly-lit, which makes it actually a really great date-place.

We’ve been to PocoLoco SO MANY TIMES, but we just had to specially go back to write this first post.

The first thing we got was the <span class="dish">Calamari al Pomodoro Piccanti ($7)</span>, which is really calamari with a spicy tomato sauce. Even though the squid was slightly tough, the batter was crispy and so simply and deliciously seasoned with salt and pepper.

Oh but you just have to have the calamari with the sauce. It’s spicy and tangy, really gives a kick to the fried squid YUMZ. (Btw, it’s not TOO spicy – on my spice scale, I would give it a 3/10)

For our mains, we both got pastas. (We tried the mushroom risotto once, but it was not mind-blowing, so we’ve always gotten pastas ever since.) We also love the pastas because their pasta’s texture is good and firm – not overcooked in the very least.

Wee Kian got the <span class="dish">Granchio ($12)</span> – crabmeat with pink sauce. Even though it was cream-based, what surprised us was that it is not gelat at all! It was really light, and Wee Kian finished it no problem. I thought it tasted like a cheese I used to eat in my childhood. We liked it because the sauce was refreshing and well-balanced. SUPER YUMZ.

I’m glad I got the <span class="dish">Manzo ($12)</span>, which is essentially a cream pasta with white truffle oil and beef, because it was a good complement to the Granchio. This pasta is more full-bodied and flavourful. You can taste the garlic, but it’s not overpowering. Together with the cream and truffle, it’s easily one of my favourite dishes. The pieces of beef are also quite substantial, and they taste really yummy with the sauce.

For dessert, we had the <span class="dish">Lava Cake ($10)</span>. I LOVE THEIR LAVA CAKE. The chocolate really oozes out, and it looks like there is more liquid chocolate than the cake. The cake itself it slightly crisp on the surface, and soft and gooey on the inside. However, it is so incredibly sweet which is so wonderfully balanced with the vanilla ice cream. Eating the cake and the oozy-goodness with the ice cream together, you get the perfect dessert. (We scraped all the chocolate and ice cream off the plate) I would highly recommend their lava cake!! THE ULTIMATE YUMMERZ.

All in all, PocoLoco is such a great date place because it has great service, food and ambience! We love it and we come here all the time. If you’re in Ang Mo Kio and are craving some good pasta, definitely try them out!
