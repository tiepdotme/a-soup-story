Lola’s Café is just a short 5-minute walk from Kovan MRT. Even though it is among shop houses the residential area, there is a big sign above the café that you won’t miss.

We went there on a Saturday afternoon at about 1pm and there was a long lunch queue with about a 15-minute wait. Fortunately, we were just 2 people who were too hungry to wait to get seated inside. There are about 4 seats outside the café and we were immediately seated WEW. 

Their menu may not seem to have a large variety of foods to choose from at first glance, but they do have interesting food combinations and choices that we have not seen elsewhere. We honestly had such a hard time choosing what we wanted to eat.

Even though we may not be artisanal-level coffee drinkers, we like to try how different cafés make their coffee. So we ordered their <span class="dish">Latte ($5)</span>. I was glad to see that their latte art was not the typical heart shape, it’s always refreshing to other latte art. The coffee was lighter than I imagined, but it was definitely acidic. Weekian was not a huge fan of the acidity, but I didn’t mind so I had most of it. I would’ve preferred the cup to have a handle, though, especially with hot coffee.

For our appetiser, we got the <span class="dish">Honey Paprika Crispy Wings ($10)</span>. True to its name, they were wonderfully crisp, and the meat just slid off its bone. I thought that the batter was pretty tasty, even though Kian disagreed. The sweetness of the honey paired really well with the savouriness of the chicken, but what was missing was the spiciness of the paprika. We could SEE the paprika on the chicken wings, but where was the TASTE?? Disappointing as it was, I was still quite satisfied with the sweet-and-salty pairing and the texture of this appetiser.

This was what I was most excited for – the <span class="dish">Crab Cake Benedict ($18)</span>. Their handmade crab cakes were so flavourful, with the skin of it ever so slightly crispy. If you order this dish (and I highly recommend that you do), you have to have everything in one bite – the crab cake, the English muffin, the runny yolk from the poached eggs, the furikake (YAS ESSENTIAL), and the miso hollandaise sauce. I know it sounds like a literal mouthful, but it’s TOTALLY worth it. Overall, I thought the flavours and textures blended so well with each other, I was so sad when I finished my half of the dish.

The <span class="dish">Grilled Chicken & Broccoli Cheese Sanger ($16)</span> took the longest to be served. We were already almost done our other dishes and were already getting quite full, but we trudged on as best as we could. In case you’re like me, a sanger is just a colloquial word for sandwich. The chicken was not dry and was slightly spicy, and I loved how the pineapple balanced it out (and they were very generous with the fruit). What was interesting was the Broccoli Cheese, which we thought was so odd, but it turned out to be delicious. We had just one half of the sanger because we really could not eat anymore.

We say… <span class="rating">7.5/10!</span> Overall, it was alright brunch, a chill place to hang out with family and friends on a weekend. We will want to try the lunch foods and the desserts though.
